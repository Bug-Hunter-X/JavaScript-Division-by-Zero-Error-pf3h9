# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug
This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero. The `myFunc` function attempts to divide `a` by `b`, but does not properly handle cases where `b` is zero. This results in an error.

The solution demonstrates how to handle this error by adding a check to see if `b` is zero before performing the division.  If `b` is zero, the function returns a default value (in this case, 0).
